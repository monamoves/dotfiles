<h1>Why is it called git?</h1>
<p>Git is a slang term for an unpleasant person. What does that say about the creators of git? Perhaps they stare into the computer and don't like what is reflected back? Maybe they hate someone and want to imagine they are controlling that person with all the git commands? git push! git fetch! Oh boy!</p>

<p>But there is no need to dwell on those thoughts. Git is a tool. Ha! It's getting worse. Another word with negative uses. Let's move on to the useful qualities of this tool called git. I'm going to add a commit to this repository.</p>

<h2>What else can we do besides....</h2>
<p>....commit, push, pull, make a new branch, merge, add? There's stash and some other commands I should explore...</p>

<h2>Stash</h2>

<p>I'm going to stash some changes. I like the word stash. It sounds more positive and hopeful, like having some delicious food stashed away. It's almost lunchtime and I have some food stashed in my bag ready to heat up and eat.</p>

<h2>Rebase</h2>
<p>Stashing was fun. Now I'm going to rebase. That sounds a bit like something from the 80's..... An unsafe activity that killed a few back then. Rebasing can solve some problems in git, unlike the other thing.</p>
